# Integrations

## Current Scope

This page summarizes implementation-backed upstream and downstream integration contracts for
`lotus-advise`. It is operator and engineering guidance for supported advisory workflows; it is not
a roadmap, client-publication claim, or substitute for provider-owned API documentation.

| Reader | Use this page for | Evidence posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engineering | Adapter ownership, runtime-composed ports, cache identity, and source-boundary rules | Backed by code, adapter tests, and repo-native gates |
| Operations | Environment bindings, degraded states, and support-safe failure behavior | Backed by current runbook and integration tests |
| Product and support | Which upstreams are authoritative for advisory behavior and which claims remain out of scope | Backed by repository context and supported-feature posture |

## Current Upstream Posture

`lotus-advise` follows the upstream contract-family map documented in RFC-0082.

## Runtime Composition Ports

Core advisory and proposal modules depend on Advise-owned ports, not concrete integration
adapters. Runtime startup wires the production providers for Lotus Core simulation/context, Lotus
Risk enrichment and dependency-state, Lotus AI narrative/memo workflow packs, and Lotus Report memo
package requests. Tests should use deterministic port doubles rather than monkeypatching HTTP
adapters into core orchestration.

Provider-specific exceptions must be translated at the runtime adapter boundary. Core logic sees
typed Advise unavailable outcomes and attaches stable authority/degraded evidence for downstream
proposal, workspace, memo, and operator surfaces.

## Consumer Contract Certification

External service adapters must keep provider-compatible fixture evidence in
`tests/fixtures/external-adapter-contracts/lotus-advise-external-adapter-contracts.v1.json`.
Run `make external-adapter-contracts` after changing `lotus-core`, `lotus-risk`, `lotus-report`,
or `lotus-ai` adapter behavior. The lane requires every adapter to cover valid responses,
malformed JSON, missing fields, portfolio/as-of identity mismatch, partial data, auth failures,
timeouts, retry or bounded non-retry posture, duplicate/idempotency behavior, provider error
mapping, and raw-payload/secret non-leakage with references to real regression tests.

## `lotus-core`

Current governed usage includes:

- advisory simulation execution
- portfolio reads
- positions reads
- cash balance reads
- instrument reference reads
- price reads
- FX reads
- enrichment-bulk support
- classification taxonomy support

Environment bindings:

- `LOTUS_CORE_BASE_URL`
- `LOTUS_CORE_QUERY_BASE_URL`

Important rule:

- simulation execution authority lives on the control-plane binding
- query reads do not substitute for execution authority
- stateful context reads must reject returned portfolio, positions, cash, or resolved-as-of identity
  that conflicts with the requested source identity before advisory snapshots are built or cached
- advisory lineage preserves Lotus Core portfolio and market-data source provenance as typed
  metadata: upstream snapshot id, source version, event or batch reference, source hash, valuation
  timestamp, freshness posture, and advisory simulation contract version. Raw Lotus Core payloads
  are not stored in proposal lineage. Conflicting provenance fails closed before snapshot
  construction, cache writes, persistence, or replay.
- source-derived FX rates must be finite, strictly positive, and as-of eligible before valuation.
  Explicit invalid rates or source ratios fail closed with `LOTUS_CORE_STATEFUL_FX_INVALID`.
  Future-only FX lookup rows are not selected, and missing eligible FX remains bounded
  data-quality evidence rather than a fabricated conversion rate.
- stateful source-row completeness is evaluated before advisory snapshots are constructed. Required
  malformed positions, cash balances, prices, or FX source rows fail closed with
  `LOTUS_CORE_STATEFUL_SOURCE_INCOMPLETE`; optional enrichment and classification taxonomy gaps are
  carried as degraded completeness evidence on resolved context and proposal lineage without raw
  source payload storage.
- stateful context resolution is selected through an explicit runtime-composed port. API startup
  registers the production Lotus Core resolver through the Advise-owned context port; integration
  modules must not discover `src.api.main`, read `sys.modules`, or rely on FastAPI import order for
  resolver behavior.

Cache policy:

- stateful context, enrichment, taxonomy, instrument, price, and FX caches are short-lived,
  process-local `TimedCache` instances
- cache TTL defaults to 15 seconds and is configured with
  `LOTUS_CORE_STATEFUL_CONTEXT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`; setting it to `0` disables reuse
- cache size defaults to 128 entries and is configured with
  `LOTUS_CORE_STATEFUL_CONTEXT_CACHE_MAX_SIZE`; oldest entries are evicted when the limit is reached
- keys are built through `stateful_context_cache_identity.py` and include sanitized source URL,
  environment, tenant, contract version, portfolio, as-of, mandate, benchmark, reporting currency,
  current look-through/allocation/risk defaults, and lookup-specific identifiers
- invalidation is TTL, size eviction, process restart, or explicit test reset only; production code
  must not clear one scope to work around missing key dimensions
- cache diagnostics expose hit, miss, write, expiration, eviction, and size counters without raw
  source payloads

## `lotus-risk`

Current governed usage includes:

- concentration and risk-lens enrichment for proposal alternatives and readiness posture

Environment binding:

- `LOTUS_RISK_BASE_URL`
- `LOTUS_RISK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `LOTUS_RISK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`
- `LOTUS_RISK_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS`

Operational behavior:

- transient `5xx`, `429`, and network failures are retried with bounded attempts
- `4xx` contract or request failures are not retried
- retry attempts default to `2` and are capped at `5`
- retry backoff defaults to `0.1` seconds and is capped at `2.0` seconds
- response metadata must not contradict the requested portfolio identity or resolved stateful
  as-of date when those fields are present
- unavailable risk authority always carries degraded evidence; dependency-state failures use
  `LOTUS_RISK_DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`, while configured enrichment failures use
  `LOTUS_RISK_ENRICHMENT_UNAVAILABLE`
- risk enrichment is selected through the Advise-owned runtime port, and provider-specific Lotus
  Risk errors are translated before core orchestration handles degraded authority.

## `lotus-performance`

Current posture:

- readiness dependency only
- not a current advisory source-data input

If advisory behavior later depends on performance analytics, that dependency should be classified explicitly instead of being inferred through another service.

## `lotus-manage`

Current governed usage includes:

- downstream consumption of `TacticalHouseViewAffectedCohort:v1`

Boundary rule:

- `lotus-advise` evaluates affected-cohort membership for supplied source-backed candidates
- `lotus-manage` owns discretionary portfolio-management campaigns, policies, rebalance workflows,
  and execution evidence

## `lotus-idea`

Current governed usage includes:

- downstream consumption of Advise data-product posture as opportunity-intelligence evidence
- source-safe proposal-intake receipt through `POST /advisory/proposals/idea-intake`

Boundary rule:

- `lotus-idea` owns idea candidates and conversion-intent evidence
- `lotus-advise` owns advisory proposal lifecycle, suitability, approval, and client-publication
  authority
- the current route proves executable intake receipt behavior and remains `not_certified`; it uses
  trusted local/dev caller headers for bounded scope and idempotency, but it does not persist
  proposal records, create orders, certify data-product realization, bind production IdP claims, or
  promote a supported feature

## `lotus-report`

Current usage:

- report-request integration boundary for Lotus-branded advisory outputs

Boundary rule:

- report ownership stays outside `lotus-advise`
- report submissions require bounded trusted tenant and actor identity; unsafe or absent identity
  fails closed before HTTP submission
- report submissions require source-derived as-of date, reporting currency, and jurisdiction; the
  mapper does not manufacture current-date, USD, or SG fallbacks
- memo and policy sign-off report packages use bounded status retrieval before projecting
  readiness. `ARCHIVED` is returned only from terminal report-owned archive evidence; accepted,
  running, missing-status, malformed-status, and status-lookup failures stay explicit pending or
  unavailable postures with the report job id preserved for recovery.
- downstream idempotency echoes must match the Advise report request id when the provider returns
  an idempotency key; mismatches fail closed.
- request overrides are selected through explicit runtime-composed requester ports registered by
  API startup. The adapter must not discover API-module globals or depend on FastAPI import order
  to choose portfolio-review, memo package, or policy sign-off package request behavior. Core memo
  orchestration calls the Advise-owned memo report-package port.

## `lotus-ai`

Current implemented usage:

- workspace-rationale integration boundary
- proposal narrative, proposal memo, policy-evidence, advisory-copilot, and workspace-rationale
  workflow-pack calls use the same trusted tenant envelope

Boundary rule:

- AI may assist with grounded rationale generation
- AI must not become the authority for suitability, approvals, trade generation, or proposal alternatives
- AI workflow-pack calls require `LOTUS_ADVISE_TENANT_ID`; unsafe or absent tenant identity fails
  closed before HTTP submission
- proposal narrative and memo AI calls are selected through Advise-owned ports. Lotus AI adapter
  errors are translated into core unavailable outcomes before proposal narrative or memo
  orchestration handles fallback posture.
