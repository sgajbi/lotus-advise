# RFC Index

Standards for all current and future RFCs:
- `docs/rfcs/RFC-CONVENTIONS.md`

Governance boundary:
- Service-specific implementation RFCs belong in this repository.
- Cross-cutting platform and multi-service RFCs belong in `https://github.com/sgajbi/lotus-platform`.

This index is the source of truth for RFC disposition in `lotus-advise`.

## Active RFCs

The active RFC set lives in a single flat sequence under `docs/rfcs/`.

The sequence is organized to read in implementation order:
- platform and runtime foundations first,
- advisory workflow and lifecycle capabilities next,
- future advisory expansion slices after the implemented core.

## Archived / Not Needed For Active Planning

| Item | Disposition | Reason | File |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RFC-0001 | Superseded / historical | First production-profile cutover was valuable, but RFC-0005 is now the unified runtime and persistence direction. | `docs/rfcs/RFC-0001-postgres-only-production-mode-cutover.md` |
| Raw advisory drafts | Archived / not needed for active planning | Historical duplicates retained for traceability only. They are not the source of truth for current advisory planning. | `docs/rfcs/archive/raw-advisory-drafts/` |

Current note:
- `RFC-0005` now owns runtime persistence direction.
- `RFC-0013` now owns lifecycle and audit model direction.
