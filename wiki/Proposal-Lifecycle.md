# Proposal Lifecycle

Current scope: every stage below is implemented and persisted. Evidence sections state what is
recorded at each transition rather than what is planned.

## Core Model

The lifecycle surface persists advisory proposals as:

- one proposal aggregate
- immutable versions
- append-only workflow events
- structured approval records
- delivery and execution posture derived from workflow history

## What Creation Does

`POST /advisory/proposals` does more than storage. It:

1. runs advisory simulation,
2. builds the deterministic proposal artifact,
3. persists the first immutable version,
4. creates workflow audit history,
5. stores idempotency mapping.

## Versioning

New versions are created through `POST /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/versions`.

The model is immutable-by-version. A later version does not overwrite the earlier one. That keeps replay, support, and audit continuity intact.

### Proposal-create replay compatibility

When a preserved proposal-create idempotency key is retried, Advise first checks the canonical
command hash. For older records whose request-model or narrative enrichment evolved, it may use
the persisted proposal, resolved context, and narrative request semantics to return the original
proposal/version. The idempotency command hash and the immutable proposal-version request hash
describe different canonicalization domains and are not required to be equal. A change to the
creator, portfolio, lifecycle context, metadata, requested narrative, or other command semantics
still fails with an idempotency conflict; callers must preserve the original key and must not
delete durable state or rotate the key to bypass that decision. Stateful legacy matching compares
each resolved proposal field exactly: omitted metadata does not act as a wildcard, while a field
that is absent on both sides remains a valid match when both stored and expected values are null.

## Transitions And Approvals

The lifecycle API separates:

- generic state transitions
- explicit approval recording

Approval and consent are structured workflow actions, not ad hoc annotations. The repository demo set includes grounded examples for:

- transition to compliance review
- client consent approval
- compliance approval
- transition to executed

Each new transition or approval applies to the current immutable proposal version. Callers may
omit `related_version_no` for compatibility; Advise then binds it to the current version and
records the version id and content hashes in audit evidence. An explicit old or nonexistent
version is rejected with HTTP 409, without changing the proposal or appending an approval/event.
Historical approvals remain readable and exact idempotent replay returns the original outcome;
neither can authorize a later version. Approval and execution-request events cannot be submitted
as generic transitions. Consent requires current-version risk or compliance approval, and an execution
handoff checks both current-version approval and consent even when the aggregate says
`EXECUTION_READY`. Advise records the handoff request only; it does not place an order.

## Delivery And Execution Posture

`lotus-advise` tracks advisory-owned delivery posture without taking over reporting or execution ownership.

It can:

- request a report payload through the `lotus-report` integration boundary
- record an execution handoff
- ingest vendor-neutral execution updates
- expose delivery summary, delivery history, and execution status

Execution handoff events and execution posture responses include structured ownership-boundary
evidence. The advisory role is handoff request and status reconciliation. The downstream execution
provider remains the execution system of record.

## Decision Summary And Alternatives

Persisted proposal surfaces expose backend-owned:

- `proposal_decision_summary`
- `proposal_alternatives`

These are part of the lifecycle evidence story and should remain tied to canonical upstream simulation and enrichment.

## Valuation-Context Evidence

Lifecycle create, version, simulation, and workspace-evaluation responses carry an additive
`valuation_context` contract inside the proposal result. It publishes separate typed evidence for
the current and simulated states:

- requested and effective as-of date or timestamp
- requested and effective reporting currency
- `READY`, `PARTIAL`, `RESTRICTED`, `UNAVAILABLE`, or `NOT_SUPPORTED` supportability
- stable reason codes when source dates disagree, a request is not honoured, or evidence is absent

Requested date and currency fields are populated only when the caller explicitly provides those
dimensions; a portfolio base currency is effective source evidence, not a synthesized request.
Stateful workspace-to-proposal handoff preserves those caller-requested dimensions through the
typed valuation context for both the current and simulated proposal states while retaining the
workspace's edited simulation payload. A source-context override changes context authority only;
it does not discard draft trades, cash flows, options, or other workspace-owned simulation input.
`ProposalResolvedContext.as_of` is an optional lifecycle context date used for evaluation, replay,
or upstream routing. Direct/stateless requests do not synthesize a current date when no reference
model or source-owned date is present. It is not authoritative valuation evidence: consumers must use
`valuation_context.current_state.effective_as_of_date` or
`valuation_context.simulated_state.effective_as_of_date`. When both requested date and currency
are not honored, `reason_code` reports the primary date reason and is not a complete mismatch list.
Core-authoritative stateful proposal create, version, and simulation resolution fails closed with
`WORKSPACE_STATEFUL_CONTEXT_AS_OF_MISSING` when the resolved source context omits its required date;
this does not change the honest nullable-date behavior for direct/stateless requests.
Normalized proposal replay evidence preserves the same lifecycle context with `as_of: null` when
the direct/stateless source context has no explicit date; it does not discard the portfolio or
snapshot identity.

The contract also carries the authoritative source service and stable source snapshot references.
Missing provenance is represented as unavailable or partial evidence; the service never substitutes
today's date, zero, pass, approval, or an inferred valuation. `lotus-core` remains the source-data
and simulation authority, while `lotus-advise` owns the lifecycle projection and does not recalculate
valuation, benchmark, limit, risk, suitability, or reporting methodology.

## Benchmark And Mandate-Limit Evidence

Proposal simulation and immutable lifecycle-version responses also carry the additive
`proposal_review_evidence` envelope. It keeps the requested benchmark and mandate identifiers and
requested as-of context separate from effective source evidence:

- `benchmark_assignment` contains requested/effective identifiers, requested/effective as-of dates,
  source references, and supportability.
- `current_mandate_limits` and `simulated_mandate_limits` are separate state projections with typed
  observations, units, thresholds, outcomes, severity, and source references when an authoritative
  producer supplies them.
- Advise consumes Core's effective-dated benchmark-assignment route under the configured admitted
  tenant. The envelope retains the returned assignment version, effective range, content hash,
  references, lineage, freshness, reconciliation, and data-quality posture. Missing authority,
  refusal, malformed evidence, and requested/effective benchmark mismatch remain explicit non-ready
  outcomes.
- No mapped source-owned mandate-limit observation contract is available. Current and simulated
  limit states therefore remain `UNAVAILABLE` with empty observations and a stable reason code.

This is an explicit capability boundary, not a positive benchmark/limit claim. Advise does not
calculate benchmark returns, limit breaches, materiality, or acceptability. A future mandate-limit
producer must supply source authority, effective dates, units, thresholds, and stable references
before either limit state can move beyond the unavailable posture.

### Memo report-package source-date handoff

The reviewed-memo report-package request maps its Lotus Report `as_of_date` from the typed
`valuation_context.current_state.effective_as_of_date` and
`valuation_context.simulated_state.effective_as_of_date` source evidence. Advise submits the
request only when those supported source values resolve to exactly one normalized date. Missing
or conflicting current/simulated dates fail closed before the downstream call; Advise never uses
the current clock date, a request-body fallback, or a guessed portfolio date.

If source mapping or the Lotus Report provider is unavailable, the API returns the documented
503 unavailable contract and does not leak an unhandled 500. Idempotent replay remains owned by
the memo event operation and does not create a downstream report job after a replayed event is
found.
