# Lotus Advise Codebase Review Ledger

## LA-REV-001

- Scope: Product surface, ecosystem fit, and architecture posture
- Pattern: Service boundaries and integration readiness
- Status: Refactor Needed
- Finding Class: modularity problem
- Summary: `lotus-advise` has a strong deterministic proposal engine, but the service is still shaped like a simulation API rather than a production advisory workstation.
- Evidence:
  - The project overview defines advisory flow primarily as advisor-entered cash/trade proposals and simulation outputs.
  - The public simulation and proposal-create contracts require callers to supply full `portfolio_snapshot`, `market_data_snapshot`, and `shelf_entries`.
  - The current capability contract is environment-flag based rather than dependency-aware.
  - Execution integration is documented as a draft RFC, not a shipped API surface.
- Consequence:
  - The app fits demos and deterministic testing well, but it does not yet own the real advisor workflow loop of sourcing household context, drafting proposals iteratively, requesting analytics, generating client-ready outputs, and handing off to execution with closed-loop status.
- Follow-Up:
  - Add lotus-core snapshot adapters and proposal workspace APIs.
  - Add downstream analytics and execution orchestration seams.
  - Promote capability reporting from env-flag truth to dependency-aware truth.

## LA-REV-002

- Scope: Integration capability contract
- Pattern: documentation drift / observability gap
- Status: Refactor Needed
- Finding Class: observability gap
- Summary: `/platform/capabilities` reports local feature flags, but not whether the service can actually complete end-to-end advisory work with required dependencies.
- Evidence:
  - `integration_capabilities.py` resolves lifecycle and async support entirely from environment flags and returns a static feature list.
- Consequence:
  - `lotus-gateway` and `lotus-workbench` can present enabled workflows even when downstream data, analytics, reporting, or execution dependencies are unavailable.
- Follow-Up:
  - Split `feature_enabled` from `operational_ready`.
  - Include dependency posture for lotus-core, lotus-performance, lotus-report, lotus-ai, and execution adapters.

## LA-REV-003

- Scope: Repository hygiene
- Pattern: stale code / dead code
- Status: Signed Off
- Finding Class: stale code
- Summary: stale active-runtime legacy source remnants were removed from `src/`, reducing ambiguity about current advisory-only ownership.
- Evidence:
  - Legacy runtime subtrees that no longer belonged to advisory were removed from the active source layout.
  - Proposal-specific integration seams and API packages now sit under clean advisory-owned paths such as `src/api/proposals/` and `src/integrations/`.
  - Active repository scans no longer find DPM naming or advisory-external runtime ownership markers across `docs`, `src`, `tests`, `scripts`, and `README.md`.
  - Advisory unit, integration, and shared contract suites passed with `231` tests.
  - `python -m compileall src scripts` completed successfully.
- Consequence:
  - New contributors are less likely to infer obsolete runtime scope from current source structure.
- Follow-Up:
  - Continue treating historical advisory-pack RFC material as archival context until a later documentation cleanup slice decides whether to retain, reframe, or rehome it.

## LA-REV-004

- Scope: API and vocabulary naming
- Pattern: documentation drift / modularity problem
- Status: Signed Off
- Finding Class: modularity problem
- Summary: The advisory public surface and active top-level governance docs were renamed away from inherited rebalance-era numbering and route-family language.
- Evidence:
  - Advisory endpoints now use the canonical `/advisory/...` route family.
  - Active top-level RFCs were renumbered into a contiguous advisory sequence ending at `RFC-0006A`.
  - Active ADRs were renumbered into a contiguous advisory sequence ending at `ADR-0004`.
  - Repository-wide scans no longer find old top-level RFC/ADR numbers or rebalance proposal route family strings in the active advisory surface.
- Consequence:
  - The advisory domain story is now much more consistent for engineers, integrators, and future documentation work.
- Follow-Up:
  - Continue tightening semantic names only where it meaningfully improves clarity without breaking established advisory contracts.

## LA-REV-005

- Scope: Proposal API directory structure
- Pattern: modularity problem
- Status: Signed Off
- Finding Class: modularity problem
- Summary: Proposal lifecycle API wiring was previously spread across generic router files, making the advisory lifecycle surface harder to navigate than necessary.
- Evidence:
  - Proposal runtime wiring, lifecycle routes, async routes, support routes, and proposal-specific HTTP error mapping now live under `src/api/proposals/`.
  - Top-level `src/api/routers/` is reduced to non-proposal router surfaces plus shared runtime utilities.
  - Advisory unit tests, advisory integration tests, compile checks, and Docker build all passed after the package move.
- Consequence:
  - New contributors can find proposal API wiring in one place, and the top-level API layout better reflects service boundaries.
- Follow-Up:
  - Preserve the cleaned public route family and keep future proposal APIs inside the dedicated proposal package unless a stronger bounded-context split is introduced.

## LA-REV-006

- Scope: Public API surface hygiene
- Pattern: stale code / backend leakage
- Status: Signed Off
- Finding Class: stale code
- Summary: The proposal supportability configuration endpoint was removed because it exposed runtime configuration and migration internals as a public advisory contract.
- Evidence:
  - `/advisory/proposals/supportability/config` returned backend readiness flags, migration namespace details, expected migration versions, and advisory-owned table names.
  - The endpoint did not support an advisor workflow, integration handshake, or client-facing decision.
  - The response model and generated vocabulary inventory carried internal persistence terminology into the public contract.
  - OpenAPI tags now include explicit descriptions so operational and business API categories remain self-explanatory without leaking internals through a dedicated supportability config route.
- Consequence:
  - The public API is narrower, easier to reason about, and less coupled to runtime implementation details.
- Follow-Up:
  - Keep internal diagnostics in logs, metrics, startup validation, and private runbooks rather than expanding public contract surface with backend configuration introspection.

## LA-REV-007

- Scope: RFC-0019 closure quality gate
- Pattern: architecture hardening / contract convergence
- Status: Signed Off
- Finding Class: modularity problem
- Summary: RFC-0019 closure work is complete and the remaining contract divergence between direct simulation and workspace evaluation was removed before closeout.
- Evidence:
  - Direct `simulate`, artifact generation, workspace reevaluation, and lifecycle create/version flows now share the same normalized `stateless` and `stateful` advisory context contract.
  - Canonical request hashing now aligns across direct simulation and workspace reevaluation for equivalent advisory inputs.
  - Async runtime recovery, replay evidence endpoints, and downstream execution update reconciliation are covered by unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
  - Final repository gates passed with `375` tests plus `ruff`, `mypy`, OpenAPI quality, no-alias governance, and vocabulary drift validation.
- Consequence:
  - `lotus-advise` now closes the advisory runtime loop defined by RFC-0019 without leaving workspace, simulation, async, and execution surfaces on inconsistent underlying rules.
- Follow-Up:
  - Move on to `RFC-0014` and `RFC-0017` follow-on work rather than reopening RFC-0019 scope.

## LA-REV-008

- Scope: Stateful Lotus Core context resolution seam
- Pattern: modularity problem / query-performance risk / test gap
- Status: Hardened
- Finding Class: query/performance risk
- Summary: The stateful advisory path had no live runtime resolver and then, once restored, still
  needed stronger hot-path discipline around repeat fetches, mutation isolation, and explicit
  environment wiring.
- Evidence:
  - `src/integrations/lotus_core/stateful_context.py` now owns the runtime translation from Lotus
    Core portfolio, positions, and cash surfaces into the canonical advisory simulation request.
  - `src/api/main.py` now exposes the resolver hook explicitly so simulation, lifecycle, and
    workspace flows all reuse the same stateful seam.
  - The adapter now derives the query-service base URL from `LOTUS_CORE_BASE_URL` when
    `LOTUS_CORE_QUERY_BASE_URL` is not set, which closes the live control-plane/query-service split
    seen in Docker.
  - A short-lived copy-safe in-memory TTL cache now prevents repeated stateful reevaluation flows
    from re-fetching identical upstream context on every call.
  - Unit coverage in `tests/unit/advisory/api/test_lotus_core_stateful_context.py` now proves:
    translation shape, invalid upstream payload handling, cache reuse, and cache mutation
    isolation.
- Consequence:
  - Stateful simulation and proposal creation now work against live Lotus Core portfolios, and the
    hot path is materially cheaper and safer under repeated evaluation workloads.
- Follow-Up:
  - If stateful workflows must support arbitrary new-trade drafting without stateless payload
    enrichment, add a governed market-data/product-shelf expansion seam rather than widening this
    adapter ad hoc.

## LA-REV-009

- Scope: Stateful workspace request construction and live trade drafting
- Pattern: correctness risk / modularity problem / test gap
- Status: Hardened
- Finding Class: race-condition or correctness risk
- Summary: Stateful workspaces were resolving Lotus Core context correctly, but they were not
  consistently applying the current draft state on top of that resolved request, and they could
  not enrich newly drafted non-held instruments from Lotus Core query data.
- Evidence:
  - `src/api/services/workspace_service.py` now applies one shared draft-state overlay path to both
    stateless and stateful workspaces.
  - Stateful workspace creation now seeds draft options from the resolved canonical request instead
    of falling back to empty default engine options.
  - `src/integrations/lotus_core/stateful_context.py` now enriches missing traded instruments with
    instrument metadata, latest price, and FX data through cached Lotus Core query lookups.
  - Unit coverage now proves:
    - stateful draft actions affect evaluation results,
    - stateful workspace parity against equivalent direct simulation at the business-result layer,
    - stateful handoff persists the current drafted proposal result,
    - missing instrument enrichment works through the adapter and the workspace API.
  - Live runtime validation against `DEMO_ADV_USD_001` confirmed:
    - a new EUR fund trade evaluates and surfaces a domain `BLOCKED` result for insufficient cash,
    - a new USD fund trade evaluates successfully and produces a non-held trade intent without
      degraded fallback.
- Consequence:
  - Stateful workspace flows now behave like real advisor drafting workflows instead of a partially
    wired context shell.
- Follow-Up:
  - If product policy requires richer issuer/liquidity metadata for new instruments, source that
    through a governed instrument-policy seam instead of hardcoding defaults in the adapter.

## LA-REV-010

- Scope: Stateful resolver cache behavior and recovery
- Pattern: query/performance risk / resilience gap
- Status: Hardened
- Finding Class: query/performance risk
- Summary: The stateful Lotus Core resolver cache needed stronger proof not just for reuse and
  eviction, but also for recovery after upstream failures so advisor workflows do not stay stuck on
  a transient bad response.
- Evidence:
  - `tests/unit/advisory/api/test_lotus_core_stateful_context.py` now proves:
    - zero-TTL disables cache reuse,
    - max-size eviction removes the oldest portfolio context,
    - failed stateful resolutions are not cached,
    - a later healthy upstream response recovers cleanly after a prior failure.
  - `tests/unit/advisory/api/test_api_workspace.py` now proves the same recovery behavior at the
    workspace API layer: an initial `WORKSPACE_STATEFUL_CONTEXT_RESOLUTION_UNAVAILABLE` response
    does not poison subsequent evaluation once Lotus Core returns a valid payload again.
  - `tests/unit/advisory/api/test_api_advisory_proposal_lifecycle.py` now proves the same
    recovery behavior for stateful lifecycle create and stateful version creation: an initial
    `PROPOSAL_STATEFUL_CONTEXT_RESOLUTION_UNAVAILABLE` failure does not poison the next request
    after Lotus Core returns a valid payload again.
  - `tests/integration/advisory/api/test_proposal_api_workflow_integration.py` now proves the
    same recovery pattern for stateful async create and stateful async version workflows: an
    initial failed operation remains operation-scoped, the next submission refetches Lotus Core
    context, and the recovered operation persists normal proposal/version replay evidence.
- Consequence:
  - The stateful hot path now has explicit regression protection for both latency discipline and
    operational recovery behavior.
- Follow-Up:
  - Keep further work focused on runtime behavior changes rather than more duplicate coverage; the
    stateful recovery pattern is now proven at adapter, workspace, lifecycle, and async workflow
    layers.

## LA-REV-011

- Scope: Async proposal-create submission idempotency
- Pattern: reliability gap / concurrency risk
- Status: Hardened
- Finding Class: reliability gap
- Summary: Async proposal creation accepted an `Idempotency-Key` but did not deduplicate at
  submission time, so retried requests could create duplicate operations and duplicate background
  execution attempts before the underlying create flow enforced lifecycle idempotency.
- Evidence:
  - `src/core/proposals/service.py` now deduplicates async proposal-create submissions by
    idempotency key and a governed submission hash.
  - Equivalent stateless request shapes now hash consistently across legacy and normalized
    `stateless_input` payloads, so callers do not get false `409` conflicts just because they used
    different but equivalent request envelopes.
  - `src/api/proposals/routes_async.py` now schedules background execution only for new async
    proposal-create operations; replayed submissions return the existing operation without
    re-enqueueing execution.
  - `tests/unit/advisory/api/test_api_advisory_proposal_lifecycle.py`,
    `tests/integration/advisory/api/test_proposal_api_workflow_integration.py`, and
    `tests/unit/advisory/engine/test_engine_proposal_workflow_service.py` now prove:
    - identical async create submissions reuse the same operation,
    - conflicting async create submissions return `409`,
    - legacy and normalized stateless create payloads are treated as semantically equivalent,
    - replayed submissions are marked as replayed internally and are not rescheduled.
- Consequence:
  - Async proposal-create now behaves like a real idempotent submission surface instead of relying
    on downstream create-time dedupe after multiple operations may already have been accepted.
- Follow-Up:
  - If async proposal-version writes ever gain a public idempotency key, apply the same
    submission-level dedupe pattern there instead of reintroducing operation-level duplication.
