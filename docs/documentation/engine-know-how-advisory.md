## API Surface

### `POST /advisory/proposals/simulate`
- Purpose: simulate advisor-entered manual cash flows and manual security trades.
- Required header: `Idempotency-Key`
- Optional header: `X-Correlation-Id` (generated when missing)
- Output: `ProposalResult` with status `READY | PENDING_REVIEW | BLOCKED`
- Unhandled errors: `500` with `application/problem+json` payload.
- Idempotency behavior:
  - same key + same canonical payload: cached response
  - same key + different canonical payload: `409 Conflict`

### `POST /advisory/proposals/artifact`
- Purpose: run proposal simulation and build deterministic advisory proposal package.
- Required header: `Idempotency-Key`
- Optional header: `X-Correlation-Id` (generated when missing)
- Output: `ProposalArtifact`
- Idempotency behavior:
  - Uses the same proposal simulation idempotency cache/hash behavior as `/advisory/proposals/simulate`.
  - Same key + different canonical payload returns `409 Conflict`.

Authority orchestration note:
- advisory proposal evaluation now routes through explicit Lotus authority seams
- `lotus-core` is the normal runtime simulation authority through the versioned canonical contract
- `lotus-risk` may provide risk enrichment authority when configured
- local evaluation is retained only as a controlled non-production fallback and test oracle in
  local/dev/test-style environments, and the response explanation includes
  `authority_resolution` metadata showing which authorities were used and whether fallback
  degradation occurred

### `POST /advisory/proposals`
- Purpose: run simulation+artifact and persist proposal aggregate/version/workflow event.
- Required header: `Idempotency-Key`
- Optional header: `X-Correlation-Id`
- Output: `ProposalCreateResponse`
- Idempotency behavior:
  - same key + same canonical request: returns same proposal/version
  - same key + different canonical request: `409 Conflict`

### `POST /advisory/proposals/async`
- Purpose: accept proposal create for asynchronous execution.
- Required header: `Idempotency-Key`
- Optional header: `X-Correlation-Id`
- Output: async operation reference (`operation_id`, `status_url`).

### `GET /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}`
- Purpose: read proposal summary + current version + last gate decision.
- Query: `include_evidence=true|false` (defaults true)

### `GET /advisory/proposals`
- Purpose: list proposals with filters and cursor pagination.
- Filters: `portfolio_id`, `state`, `created_by`, `created_from`, `created_to`, `limit`, `cursor`

### `GET /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/versions/{version_no}`
- Purpose: read one immutable proposal version.
- Query: `include_evidence=true|false`

### `GET /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/workflow-events`
- Purpose: retrieve append-only workflow timeline for operations investigation and audit.

### `GET /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/approvals`
- Purpose: retrieve structured approval/consent records for supportability and controls review.

### `GET /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/lineage`
- Purpose: retrieve immutable version lineage metadata (request/simulation/artifact hashes).

### `GET /advisory/proposals/idempotency/{idempotency_key}`
- Purpose: resolve idempotency-key mappings during retry and incident investigations.

### `GET /advisory/proposals/operations/{operation_id}`
- Purpose: retrieve asynchronous operation status and terminal result/error payload.

### `GET /advisory/proposals/operations/by-correlation/{correlation_id}`
- Purpose: retrieve latest asynchronous operation by correlation id.

### `POST /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/versions`
- Purpose: create immutable version `N+1` for existing proposal.
- Guard: same `portfolio_id` as aggregate unless `PROPOSAL_ALLOW_PORTFOLIO_CHANGE_ON_NEW_VERSION=true`.

### `POST /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/versions/async`
- Purpose: accept proposal version create for asynchronous execution.
- Optional header: `X-Correlation-Id`
- Output: async operation reference (`operation_id`, `status_url`).

### `POST /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/transitions`
- Purpose: apply one workflow transition.
- Concurrency: `expected_state` required by default (`PROPOSAL_REQUIRE_EXPECTED_STATE=true`).

### `POST /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/approvals`
- Purpose: persist structured approval/consent and corresponding workflow event.
- Approval types: `RISK`, `COMPLIANCE`, `CLIENT_CONSENT`

### `POST /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/report-requests`
- Purpose: request a Lotus-branded advisory report payload through the lotus-report seam.
- Ownership rule: lotus-advise assembles advisory context, but reporting ownership remains with
  `lotus-report`.

### `POST /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/execution-handoffs`
- Purpose: record an auditable advisory execution handoff request for an execution provider.
- State rule: proposal must already be `EXECUTION_READY`.

### `GET /advisory/proposals/{proposal_id}/execution-status`
- Purpose: derive advisory execution correlation state from append-only workflow history.
- Output: explicit `NOT_REQUESTED | REQUESTED | EXECUTED` handoff posture with latest correlated
  execution event metadata.

Persistence note:
- Lifecycle persistence supports repository backends selected by runtime config.
- Runtime wiring and repository bootstrap live under `src/api/proposals/runtime.py`.
- Postgres-backed persistence is implemented (`PROPOSAL_STORE_BACKEND=POSTGRES`).
- In-memory persistence remains a test-only helper and is not part of the active advisory runtime
  posture.

## Pipeline (`run_proposal_simulation`)

Authority note:
- `run_proposal_simulation` remains the local deterministic engine implementation
- active API, workspace, and lifecycle flows reach it only through the advisory orchestration layer
  when the explicit non-production fallback policy is enabled

1. Validate and gate
- Requires `options.enable_proposal_simulation=true` at API layer.
- Validates proposal input models (`ProposedCashFlow`, `ProposedTrade`).

2. Before-state valuation
- Uses the shared portfolio valuation stack (`build_simulated_state`).

3. Apply proposal intents
- Cash flows can be applied before trades (`proposal_apply_cash_flows_first`).
- Trades are manually supplied and priced from market data.
- For notional-driven trades, `notional.currency` must match priced instrument currency; mismatch blocks with `PROPOSAL_INVALID_TRADE_INPUT`.
- RFC-0008 auto-funding:
  - Build funding plan per BUY currency.
  - Generate `FX_SPOT` intents for deficits using `BASE_ONLY` or `ANY_CASH` policy.
  - Apply deterministic dependencies from BUY intents to generated FX intent ids.
- Deterministic ordering:
  - `CASH_FLOW` (as provided)
  - `SECURITY_TRADE` SELL (instrument ascending)
  - `FX_SPOT` (pair ascending)
  - `SECURITY_TRADE` BUY (instrument ascending)

4. Safety and shelf guards
- Blocks on withdrawal-driven negative cash when enabled (`proposal_block_negative_cash`).
- Blocks disallowed BUY trades (`SELL_ONLY`, `BANNED`, `SUSPENDED`, and `RESTRICTED` unless `allow_restricted=true`).

5. After-state, rules, reconciliation
- Simulates portfolio mutation using shared primitives.
- Runs standard rule engine (`RuleEngine.evaluate`).
- Performs proposal reconciliation against expected cash-flow-adjusted total.
- Derives deterministic `proposal_run_id` from request hash when provided.

- `summary`
- `portfolio_impact`
- `trades_and_funding`
- `suitability_summary`
- `assumptions_and_limits`

- `artifact_hash` from canonical JSON that excludes volatile fields:
  - `created_at`
  - `evidence_bundle.hashes.artifact_hash`

## Workspace Foundation and Mutation Loop

Current workspace scope:
- `POST /advisory/workspaces` creates a draft workspace session in `stateless` or `stateful` mode.
- `GET /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}` returns current draft state and latest evaluation.
- `POST /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/draft-actions` applies a single deterministic draft mutation and re-evaluates when evaluation context is available.
- `POST /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/evaluate` re-runs deterministic evaluation for the current workspace draft.
- `POST /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/save` captures a replay-safe saved workspace version.
- `GET /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/saved-versions` returns the saved version history for support, resume, and compare workflows.
- `POST /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/resume` restores a saved version into the current editable draft.
- `POST /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/compare` compares the current draft to a saved version baseline.
- `POST /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/assistant/rationale` generates an evidence-grounded workspace rationale through the explicit Lotus AI workflow-pack seam.
- `POST /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/assistant/rationale/review-actions` applies bounded workflow-pack review actions for the rationale run without rewriting the rationale narrative.
- `POST /advisory/workspaces/{workspace_id}/handoff` bridges the current draft into persisted proposal lifecycle without duplicating lifecycle ownership.

Current Slice 2 draft actions:
- `ADD_TRADE`
- `UPDATE_TRADE`
- `REMOVE_TRADE`
- `ADD_CASH_FLOW`
- `UPDATE_CASH_FLOW`
- `REMOVE_CASH_FLOW`
- `REPLACE_OPTIONS`

Current evaluation rule:
- stateless workspaces support full deterministic re-evaluation from the embedded simulation context
- stateful workspaces can resolve deterministic evaluation context through the Lotus Core advisory context seam when it is configured
- unresolved stateful workspaces fail explicitly with `WORKSPACE_STATEFUL_CONTEXT_RESOLUTION_UNAVAILABLE`

Current saved-version rule:
- saved workspace versions are retained within the active workspace session and expose replay-safe evidence
- resume restores the saved draft state, evaluation summary, and replay evidence without hidden reconstruction
- compare currently returns deterministic summary deltas against a saved baseline version

Current handoff rule:
- the first workspace handoff creates a persisted proposal and records a lifecycle link on the workspace
- later workspace handoffs create new versions on the linked proposal instead of creating duplicate proposal aggregates
- stateless workspaces support lifecycle handoff directly from embedded simulation payloads
- stateful workspaces support lifecycle handoff when the Lotus Core advisory context seam can resolve replay-safe simulation inputs

Current AI assistance rule:
- workspace AI rationale is available only for evaluated workspaces
- the Lotus AI seam receives a deterministic evidence bundle containing workspace identity, resolved context, evaluation summary, proposal status, and advisor instruction
- the advisory runtime now sends that bundle through `workspace_rationale.pack@v1` on the explicit Lotus AI workflow-pack execution route
- the response always includes that evidence bundle and now also preserves bounded workflow-pack run posture so the AI output remains reviewable and grounded
- bounded review actions for that run are exposed on a separate route that forwards Lotus AI `replacement_run_id` lineage unchanged for `REVISE` and `SUPERSEDE`
- review-action responses update only workflow-pack posture and summary; they do not imply that the workspace rationale text itself was rewritten
- the live runtime parity validator now proves that this seam executes end to end, emits distinct replacement run ids, and marks the superseded run as `HISTORICAL`

Current capability-truth rule:
- `/platform/capabilities` reports supported input modes as `stateless` and `stateful`
- feature enablement is separated from operational readiness
- workflow readiness now exposes dependency keys, degraded reasons, and fallback posture where applicable
- report-request readiness now reflects `lotus-report` dependency truth
- execution handoff remains advisory-owned while external provider state stays upstream-owned

Dependency quality gate:
- `scripts/dependency_health_check.py --requirements requirements.txt`
- CI runs this check before lint/test to enforce vulnerability visibility.

## Deprecation Notes

- `src/core/advisory/engine.py` is a compatibility shim and emits `DeprecationWarning`.
- Use `src/core/advisory_engine.py` as the current stable advisory engine import path.
