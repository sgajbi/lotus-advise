## Before The First Command

On Windows, GNU Make is not present by default and must be installed separately. winget,
Chocolatey, Scoop and MSYS2 all provide it. Which one supplies it does not matter; two other
things do.

**It must be on the PATH of the shell you run these commands in.** MSYS2 installs `make`
inside its own prefix and does not normally expose it to PowerShell, so run the commands from
the MSYS2 shell or add its binary directory to PATH.

**A POSIX shell must back it.** GNU Make runs each recipe through `$(SHELL)`, which on
Windows resolves to `SHELL` if set, otherwise `sh.exe` if one is on PATH, and otherwise
`cmd.exe`. Two recipes here cannot run under `cmd.exe`:

- `coverage-combined` (`Makefile:270-272`) begins lines with `COVERAGE_FILE=... python ...`,
  a POSIX-only assignment prefix. Reached by `make ci` and `make ci-local`.
- `docker-build` (`Makefile:284-294`) uses backslash line continuations, which `cmd.exe` does
  not honour. Reached by `make ci`.

`lint`, `typecheck`, `test-unit` and the gate targets use neither and run either way. So a
machine can pass `make --version` and still fail every PR-grade command. Confirm both before
continuing:

```powershell
make --version
Get-Command sh.exe
```

If `sh.exe` does not resolve, install Git for Windows (which supplies one at
`C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\sh.exe`) and confirm it is on PATH, or set `SHELL` to a POSIX
shell before invoking make. Git Bash, MSYS2 and WSL all satisfy this.

`make install` resolves to `install-ci`, which runs `python -m pip install` directly rather than
into a managed environment. Create and activate a virtualenv FIRST: PEP 668 distributions (most
current Linux packages, and Homebrew Python on macOS) mark the system interpreter externally
managed and refuse a system-wide `pip install`. This has not been reproduced by the maintainers;
it is the specified behaviour of PEP 668. CI does not need the step because `actions/setup-python`
supplies an isolated interpreter, which is why the requirement stays invisible in a green
pipeline.

`venv/` is this repository's conventional location and is already gitignored.

On Linux or macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
if ((Get-Command python).Source -ne (Resolve-Path .\venv\Scripts\python.exe).Path) {
    throw "venv is not active - do not run make install, it would install globally"
}
```

Activation is verified rather than assumed: `Activate.ps1` fails silently under a
restrictive execution policy, and every command after it would then target the system
interpreter instead of the virtualenv.

## Key Commands

- `make install`
- `make check`
- `make ci`
- `make ci-local-docker`
- `make run`
- `make docker-up` / `make docker-down`

Bring the local runtime up with `make docker-up` rather than `docker compose up -d --build`.
The target exports the build arguments the compose file forwards, so `/version` on the running
service reports the commit it was built from, and a checkout with uncommitted changes is
stamped `<sha>-dirty` instead of claiming that commit. A plain compose build takes the
`unknown` argument defaults, so evidence gathered against it cannot be attributed to any
revision.

## Local Expectations

`lotus-advise` expects canonical upstream integrations to be explicit during local Docker validation:

- `LOTUS_CORE_BASE_URL`
- `LOTUS_CORE_QUERY_BASE_URL`
- `LOTUS_RISK_BASE_URL`
- `LOTUS_RISK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `LOTUS_RISK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`
- `LOTUS_RISK_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS`
- `LOTUS_ADVISE_TENANT_ID`

These bindings keep proposal simulation and advisory risk-lens behavior aligned to the actual upstream authorities instead of local stand-ins.
The app-local Compose manifest supplies `LOTUS_ADVISE_TENANT_ID=tenant-sg-001` as the canonical
developer fixture so standalone Advise and Workbench-orchestrated local startup do not require an
external identity provider. Production Compose still requires deployment-owned tenant configuration
and must not use the local fixture as tenant-isolation or entitlement proof.
Lotus Risk enrichment retries transient `5xx`, `429`, and network failures with bounded operator
configuration: retry attempts default to `2` and cap at `5`, while retry backoff defaults to `0.1`
seconds and caps at `2.0` seconds.

## API Discovery

Once the service is running:

- OpenAPI UI: `/docs`
- health: `/health`
- liveness: `/health/live`
- readiness: `/health/ready`

## Demo Scenarios

The repository includes grounded demo payloads under `docs/demo/`.

Representative flows:

- proposal simulation via `POST /advisory/proposals/simulate`
- artifact generation via `POST /advisory/proposals/artifact`
- persisted proposal creation via `POST /advisory/proposals`

The demo set also covers:

- auto-funding
- blocked FX cases
- drift analytics
- suitability outcomes
- artifact generation
- lifecycle transitions
- client consent and compliance approval
- execution-ready and executed state progression
