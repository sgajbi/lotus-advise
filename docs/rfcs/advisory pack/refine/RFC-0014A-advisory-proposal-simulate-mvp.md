## 0. Executive Summary

This RFC introduces an **Advisory Proposal Simulation** endpoint to support the private-banking advisory workflow where an advisor proposes **specific manual trades** and **cash flows** (deposit/withdrawal) and needs to instantly visualize the portfolio impact.

This is **not** a full rebalance. It **bypasses targeting** and instead simulates the advisor's instructions deterministically, returning the same institutional audit bundle style as the rebalance engine.

This RFC implements only the **foundation**:
- `POST /rebalance/proposals/simulate`
- Supports `proposed_trades[]` and `proposed_cash_flows[]`
- Applies cash flows **before** simulating trades
- Produces a full **before/after simulated state**, intents, and rule results (no-throw)

> The draft RFC-0014 also mentions Auto-Funding, Drift Analytics, and Suitability scanning. Those are intentionally deferred to later RFCs.

---

## 1. Motivation / Problem Statement

Advisors often need to pitch a **specific idea** ("sell X, buy Y, client deposits Z") rather than trigger a full algorithmic rebalance.

Key gaps this RFC closes:
- **Operational gap:** simulate “what if” proposals without manual spreadsheet math.
- **Workflow gap:** create a proposal artifact that can later plug into suitability, consent, and execution steps.
- **Platform gap:** allow advisory proposals to reuse existing institutional infrastructure: deterministic simulation, after-state completeness, evidence bundle, rule results.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope (RFC-0014A)
1. **New endpoint**: `POST /rebalance/proposals/simulate`
2. **Inputs**:
   - portfolio snapshot
   - market data snapshot
   - shelf entries (product governance)
   - options
   - proposed trades (manual)
   - proposed cash flows (manual)
3. **Logic**:
   - **Bypass targeting** (no model target weights generation).
   - Apply cash flows **before** trade simulation.
   - Deterministic ordering of intents and deterministic output.
4. **Outputs**:
   - Proposal result bundle including: before, after, intents, diagnostics, rule results, reconciliation, lineage IDs

### 2.2 Explicitly Out of Scope (RFC-0014A)
- **Auto-funding (FX generation)** (defer to RFC-0014B)
- **Drift analytics (model alignment)** (defer to RFC-0014C)
- **Suitability scanning / new vs resolved risks** (defer to RFC-0014D)
- Persistence / DB / durable idempotency

---

## 3. Advisory Workflow Placement

This endpoint supports the "Idea -> Proposal" stage:

1. Advisor enters proposed trades + cash flows
2. Engine returns a deterministic simulation + audit bundle
3. Advisor reviews:
   - feasibility
   - safety hard blocks
   - after-state allocation
   - cash impact
4. Future RFCs will add:
   - suitability report for compliance narrative
   - proposal artifact packaging for client-facing documents
   - workflow gating to consent / execution

---

## 4. Contract Decisions

### 4.1 Endpoint
`POST /rebalance/proposals/simulate`

Rationale:
- Keep endpoint in the existing `/rebalance/...` family.
- Use explicit `proposals` resource naming for clarity.
- Keep clear separation of "algorithmic rebalance" vs "manual advisory proposal".

### 4.2 Headers
- `Idempotency-Key` (required)
- `X-Correlation-Id` (optional; generated if missing)

### 4.3 Response codes
- `200 OK`: Always returned for domain outcomes (READY / PENDING_REVIEW / BLOCKED)
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: schema validation errors
- `409 Conflict`: idempotency key mismatch (same key, different canonical request hash)
- `500`: unexpected bug (should not happen; must emit RFC7807)

**Important**: This RFC follows “no-throw domain outcomes” as described in your existing architecture docs. (Domain infeasibility should be surfaced in `status=BLOCKED` + rule results/diagnostics rather than 422.)

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 New Input Models

#### 5.1.1 ProposedCashFlow
```json
{
  "intent_type": "CASH_FLOW",
  "currency": "USD",
  "amount": "10000.00",
  "description": "Client deposit"
}
````

Rules:

* `amount > 0` -> deposit
* `amount < 0` -> withdrawal
* amount is `Decimal` string; no floats allowed

#### 5.1.2 ProposedTrade (manual)

Reuse existing `SECURITY_TRADE` intent structure from rebalance outputs, but as an input.

```json
{
  "intent_type": "SECURITY_TRADE",
  "side": "BUY",
  "instrument_id": "AAPL",
  "quantity": "12"
}
```

Rules:

* Either `quantity` or `notional` must be provided (implementation may support both; must validate strictly)

### 5.2 ProposalSimulateRequest (canonical)

```json
{
  "portfolio_snapshot": { ... },
  "market_data_snapshot": { ... },
  "shelf_entries": [ ... ],
  "options": { ... },
  "proposed_cash_flows": [ ... ],
  "proposed_trades": [ ... ]
}
```

Notes:

* Keep naming aligned with your existing rebalance request (`portfolio_snapshot`, `market_data_snapshot`, `shelf_entries`, `options`) to reuse parsing, validators, and demo tooling.

### 5.3 ProposalResult (output)

`ProposalResult` should mirror `RebalanceResult` shape to maximize reuse and maintain a consistent audit bundle across endpoints.

Minimum required fields:

* `proposal_run_id` (new prefix, e.g., `pr_...`)
* `correlation_id`
* `status` (READY / PENDING_REVIEW / BLOCKED)
* `before` (full)
* `intents` (includes cash flows + trades, deterministic ordering)
* `after_simulated` (full)
* `rule_results`
* `diagnostics`
* `lineage`:

  * `request_hash`
  * snapshot IDs if provided
  * engine version

---

## 6. Algorithm / Processing Pipeline

### 6.1 Deterministic intent ordering

To avoid ambiguity and support deterministic goldens, intent ordering must be:

1. `CASH_FLOW` intents (as provided, stable order)
2. `SECURITY_TRADE` SELL intents (instrument_id ascending)
3. `SECURITY_TRADE` BUY intents (instrument_id ascending)

> Auto-generated FX intents are not part of 14A (added in 14B).

### 6.2 Core flow

1. **Validate request**

   * schema validation
   * enforce Decimal strings
   * enforce required headers

2. **Build before-state**

   * compute portfolio total value in base currency
   * compute allocations (by instrument + by asset class if available)
   * compute reconciliation baseline

3. **Apply cash flows**

   * adjust cash balances by currency
   * enforce:

     * withdrawals cannot make cash negative unless an explicit overdraft facility exists (not in scope here -> default: block)
   * record diagnostics for any issues

4. **Simulate manual trades**

   * use existing simulator primitives (same as rebalance after-state simulation)
   * enforce safety:

     * no-short / no-oversell
     * shelf semantics: do not allow BUY for SELL_ONLY / BANNED / SUSPENDED
     * missing price/fx handling based on existing options flags

5. **Run rule engine**

   * same rule set as rebalance (as already implemented)
   * produce rule results and set status:

     * any HARD fail -> BLOCKED
     * soft fails -> PENDING_REVIEW
     * else READY

6. **Return ProposalResult**

   * include complete `after_simulated`
   * include reconciliation proof

---

## 7. Diagnostics and Reason Codes

RFC-0014A adds these proposal-specific diagnostics codes:

* `PROPOSAL_WITHDRAWAL_NEGATIVE_CASH` (hard block)
* `PROPOSAL_INVALID_TRADE_INPUT` (schema-level 422)
* `PROPOSAL_TRADE_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_SHELF` (hard block if BUY of disallowed instrument)

Reuses existing safety reason codes from rebalance:

* `NO_SHORTING`
* `SELL_EXCEEDS_HOLDINGS`
* `INSUFFICIENT_CASH`
* missing price/fx reason codes (based on existing implementation)

## 9. Testing Plan

### 9.1 Unit tests (new)

1. Cash flow application:

   * deposit increases cash correctly
   * withdrawal that makes cash negative -> BLOCKED + diagnostic
2. Manual trade simulation:

   * BUY reduces cash
   * SELL increases cash
   * oversell blocks
3. Determinism:

   * stable intent ordering
   * identical request yields identical output JSON (golden friendly)

### 9.2 Golden scenario (new)

Add: `tests/advisory/golden_data/scenario_14A_advisory_manual_trade_cashflow.json`

Scenario:

* Portfolio: base SGD, has SGD cash + a holding
* Proposal:

  * deposit SGD 10,000
  * BUY an approved instrument with known price
    Expected:
* `after_simulated` includes updated cash and position
* status READY/PENDING_REVIEW depending on configured cash band / min trade settings
* reconciliation passes

---

## 10. Rollout

1. Add endpoint behind docs/demo usage (no persistence)
2. Validate with a small scenario set (goldens)
3. Extend with RFC-0014B (Auto-Funding) once 14A stabilizes

---

## 11. Follow-up RFCs (Planned)

* **RFC-0014B**: Auto-Funding for Proposals (FX spot intent generation + dependencies)
* **RFC-0014C**: Drift Analytics (Before/After vs Model alignment metrics)
* **RFC-0014D**: Suitability Scanner v1 (New/Resolved/Persistent issues)
* **RFC-0014E**: Proposal Artifact Packaging (client-ready narrative bundle)

## Behavior Reference (Implemented)

1. Inputs are simulated in deterministic sequence: cash flows first, then security trades with stable ordering.
2. Proposal BUYs on disallowed shelf statuses are hard-blocked with proposal-specific diagnostics.
3. If `proposal_block_negative_cash=true`, withdrawal-driven negative cash is hard-blocked.
4. Final status is still derived from shared hard/soft rule semantics (`READY`, `PENDING_REVIEW`, `BLOCKED`).
5. Idempotency behavior is deterministic: same `Idempotency-Key` plus same canonical payload returns cached-equivalent output; same key with different payload returns conflict.
