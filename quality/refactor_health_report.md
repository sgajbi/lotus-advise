  after classifying public API and module ownership thresholds.

  classifying validator and compatibility-facade findings.
- Calibrate Radon complexity enforcement beyond the current no-C/D/E/F gate after
  classifying current B-ranked blocks.
- Expand Bandit security enforcement beyond high severity after classifying current
  SQL-construction findings and resolving true positives.
- Convert the deptry dependency inventory into a fail-on-new-regression gate after

  thresholds.
