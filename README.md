## Demo Readiness Fast Path

For a demo, use the governed proof flow instead of ad hoc screenshots or slide language:

1. validate the service and dependencies with the repo-native gates below,
2. run or review `make demo-certification-live` evidence for the target runtime,
3. validate the canonical front-office path for `PB_SG_GLOBAL_BAL_001` before screenshots,
4. review [wiki/Demo-Readiness-Guide.md](wiki/Demo-Readiness-Guide.md) for audience-specific
   preparation,
5. use [docs/commercial/RFC-0028-bank-demo-client-proof-materials.md](docs/commercial/RFC-0028-bank-demo-client-proof-materials.md)
   for claim-controlled demo and RFP wording,
6. keep these blocked claims visible: client-ready publication, external client communication,
   legal/regulatory advice, bank-specific certification, completed approval/sign-off authority, and
   OMS/order/fill/settlement.

## Purpose And Scope

`lotus-advise` owns advisory-only workflow behavior in the Lotus ecosystem.

It is responsible for:

- advisory proposal simulation orchestration
- deterministic proposal artifact generation
- advisory workspace drafting and handoff
- persisted proposal lifecycle state and immutable versioning
- approvals, consent, and execution-readiness posture
- backend-owned `proposal_decision_summary` and `proposal_alternatives`
- advisor-review proposal narrative evidence with governed review/replay, downstream
  report/render/archive posture, Gateway/Workbench exposure, data-product declaration, trust
  telemetry, capability discovery, live runtime proof, and governed Workbench canonical proof
- enterprise policy-pack catalog and advisor/compliance policy evaluation evidence with governed
  source readiness, finalized evaluation records, replay, workflow/sign-off posture, report-package
  lineage, bounded AI evidence, Gateway/Workbench exposure, active data-product declaration, and
  trust telemetry
- source-owned tactical house-view affected cohorts from bank-authored house-view instructions and
  caller-supplied source-backed candidate portfolios
- source-safe `lotus-idea` proposal-intake route foundation for future opportunity-to-advisory
  realization, without proposal creation, suitability authority, client publication, or supported
  feature promotion

It does not own discretionary management workflows, portfolio source data, risk methodology,
performance methodology, reporting ownership, or downstream execution ownership.

## Ownership And Boundaries

`lotus-advise` sits between product consumers and authoritative upstream services.

It depends on:

- `lotus-core`
  canonical portfolio context, source-data reads, and advisory simulation authority
- `lotus-risk`
  risk-lens enrichment and concentration authority
- `lotus-report`
  report-request integration boundary
- `lotus-ai`
  workspace-rationale integration boundary
- `lotus-gateway`
  primary integrated product-facing consumer

Boundary rules that matter:

1. advisory-only workflows belong here; management workflows belong in `lotus-manage`
2. proposal alternatives and decision-summary semantics are backend-owned surfaces, not UI-derived interpretations
3. proposal simulation and alternatives must stay anchored to canonical upstream authorities
4. tactical house-view cohorts consume source-backed candidate portfolios and do not discover the
   global portfolio universe, open rebalance waves, approve trades, or integrate with OMS
5. execution handoff, status, and delivery responses carry explicit ownership-boundary evidence;
   `lotus-advise` records advisory posture while downstream providers remain execution systems of
   record
6. REST/OpenAPI remains the governed integration contract for current upstream calls

## Current Operational Posture

1. `lotus-advise` is scoped to advisory-only workflows after the split from `lotus-manage`.
2. Proposal simulation, artifact, workspace, replay, and lifecycle flows now expose persisted
   backend-owned `proposal_decision_summary` and `proposal_alternatives`.
3. Runtime smoke and production-profile guardrail validation are part of the actual CI contract.
4. Live operator evidence covers canonical and degraded decision-summary and alternatives posture.
5. `TacticalHouseViewAffectedCohort:v1` is a governed source-owned cohort product for downstream
   discretionary portfolio-management workflows in `lotus-manage`, bounded to supplied eligible
   candidates and preserved lineage.
6. `AdvisoryPolicyEvaluationRecord:v1` is an active advisor/compliance policy evidence product for
   RFC-0025. Runtime catalog, activation, audit, idempotency, and evaluation state is backed by
   policy repository ports and the `policy_packs` Postgres migration namespace. Completed
   approval/waiver authority, completed sign-off authority, client-ready policy publication, and
   external client communication remain gated.
7. `AdvisorCockpitOperatingSnapshot:v1` and `AdvisoryActionItemRegister:v1` are active
   source-owned RFC-0026 advisor operating workflow products. They cover Advise action items,
   snapshot, supportability, acknowledgements, Gateway/Workbench consumption, and canonical
   `PB_SG_GLOBAL_BAL_001` proof while client-ready publication, external client communication,
   CRM system-of-record behavior, OMS lifecycle, and completed policy approval authority remain
   gated. RFC-0028 bank-demo/RFP proof is governed separately through supported claims.
8. RFC-0028 bank-demo proof is implemented through the Advise scenario contract, supported-claim
   register, sanitized proof-pack capture, Gateway publication, Platform canonical contract
   registration, and Workbench `advisory.bank_demo_proof` surface. Canonical validation for
   `PB_SG_GLOBAL_BAL_001` records `BANK_DEMO_PROOF_PACK_CREATED` and keeps client-ready
   publication, external client communication, OMS/order/fill/settlement, and unsupported
   RFP/demo collateral claims blocked. Claim-controlled commercial material is governed by the
   supported-claim register. Slice 9 adds
   `AdvisoryJourneyIntegrationProofSummary:v1` and
   `journey-integration-proof-summary.json` so the backend proof pack now carries sanitized
   AI/model-risk, policy, and advisor-cockpit boundary evidence without promoting AI authority,
   legal advice, policy approval, or client-ready publication. Slice 10 adds claim-controlled
   commercial, RFP, security, architecture, ROI, demo, feature-matrix, proof-guide, boundary, and
   operator material through `docs/commercial/RFC-0028-bank-demo-client-proof-materials.md` and
   `commercial-material-pack.json`, while keeping client-ready publication, external client
   communication, bank-specific attestations, legal/regulatory advice, completed sign-off, and
   OMS/order/fill/settlement claims blocked. Slice 11 adds sanitized runtime security posture,
   integer `latency_ms` evidence, runtime URL hygiene, and sensitive-summary redaction to
   `runtime-posture.json` and `sanitized-runtime-summary.json`. Slice 12 makes that product truth
   explicit in README and wiki source so operators, pre-sales, and engineers use the same
   implementation-backed proof boundaries. Slice 13/14 closes final implementation proof and
   hardening through local artifact-reference normalization, safe HTTP 422 validation error
   responses that do not echo rejected sensitive input, targeted proof tests, PR Merge Gate, and
   Main Releasability Gate run `26573760885` on merge
   `a99474e5457dcdd4c87e79faf83bc8f64580544b`. Slice 15/16 closes durable
   docs/context/wiki truth and post-completion communication evidence through `lotus-platform`
   PR #369 at `26d74e65e231ac3d62457187c6eb7f787a4d9f88`, Main Releasability Gate run
   `26574820026`, and
   `lotus-platform/thought-leadership/linkedin/drafts/LI-2026-05-28-043-demo-proof-should-show-the-boundary.md`.
   Current proof capture also validates ready `/platform/capabilities` runtime evidence and blocks
   stale proof reuse when `advisory.bank_demo_proof` or `advisory_bank_demo_proof` is missing.
9. The `lotus-idea` advisory proposal intake route foundation is implemented at
   `POST /advisory/proposals/idea-intake` with contract evidence under
   `contracts/idea-proposal-intake/`. It proves route existence only. It does not create advisory
   proposal records, grant suitability authority, authorize client publication, create orders,
   certify a data product, or promote a supported feature.

## Architecture At A Glance

Main runtime surfaces come from [src/api/main.py](src/api/main.py):

- advisory simulation
  `POST /advisory/proposals/simulate`
  `POST /advisory/proposals/artifact`
- advisory proposal lifecycle
  create, version, transition, approval, delivery, execution, async, and support routes under
  `/advisory/proposals/*`
  plus the source-safe `POST /advisory/proposals/idea-intake` route foundation for `lotus-idea`
  conversion-intent handoff
- advisory workspace
  iterative draft, save, resume, compare, rationale, and lifecycle handoff under
  `/advisory/workspaces/*`
- tactical house view
  source-owned affected-cohort evaluation under `/advisory/tactical-house-view/*`
- advisor cockpit
  source-owned action, snapshot, supportability, and acknowledgement routes under
  `/advisory/cockpit/*`
- bank demo proof
  source-owned scenario contract, supported-claim register, and sanitized proof-pack capture through
  `GET /advisory/bank-demo-proof/scenario-contract`,
  `GET /advisory/bank-demo-proof/supported-claim-register`, and
  `POST /advisory/bank-demo-proof/proof-packs`
- integration capabilities
  `GET /platform/capabilities`
- platform surfaces

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

Run the service locally:

```bash
make run
```

Canonical local service identity for cross-app and demo-oriented flows:

- `http://advise.dev.lotus`

Quick probes:

```bash
curl http://advise.dev.lotus/health
curl http://advise.dev.lotus/health/ready
curl http://advise.dev.lotus/version
```

OpenAPI UI:

- `/docs`

Important local Docker runtime bindings:

- `LOTUS_CORE_BASE_URL`
- `LOTUS_CORE_QUERY_BASE_URL`
- `LOTUS_RISK_BASE_URL`
- `LOTUS_RISK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `LOTUS_RISK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`
- `LOTUS_RISK_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS`

Canonical local Docker upstream defaults:

- `LOTUS_CORE_BASE_URL=http://core-control.dev.lotus`
- `LOTUS_CORE_QUERY_BASE_URL=http://core-query.dev.lotus`
- `LOTUS_RISK_BASE_URL=http://risk.dev.lotus`

Lotus Risk enrichment uses bounded retries for transient `5xx`, `429`, and network failures.
`LOTUS_RISK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` defaults to `2` and must be between `1` and `5`;
`LOTUS_RISK_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` defaults to `0.1` seconds and must be between `0.001`
and `2.0` seconds. Explicit malformed or out-of-range numeric integration settings fail
startup/readiness instead of falling back silently.

## API Contract Notes

Important public route groups:

1. advisory simulation and artifact
2. persisted proposal lifecycle
3. advisory operations and support
4. advisory workspace
5. tactical house-view affected-cohort evaluation
6. policy-pack catalog and policy-evaluation evidence
7. advisor cockpit action, snapshot, supportability, and acknowledgement evidence
8. bank-demo proof contract and proof-pack capture
9. integration capabilities

Contract rules that are easy to get wrong:

1. proposal simulation and artifact flows require `Idempotency-Key`
2. lifecycle persistence is immutable-by-version
3. support and delivery posture derive from append-only workflow history
4. workspace rationale and RFC-0023 advisor-review proposal narrative are separate governed AI
   integration boundaries; advisor-review narrative is implemented for proposal artifact,
   review/replay, reviewed report-request package, report/render/archive, Gateway posture,
   Workbench posture, standalone read, and non-persistent regeneration, while client-ready
   narrative remains gated
5. tactical house-view cohort responses must preserve upstream source refs and supportability posture
   instead of recomputing portfolio source facts locally
6. policy evaluation endpoints preserve source/policy/evaluation/replay hashes and must not imply
   legal advice, completed approval/waiver authority, completed sign-off authority, or client-ready
   publication
7. advisor cockpit endpoints preserve source refs, action lineage, SLA/acknowledgement posture, and
   unsupported-claim boundaries; acknowledgements do not approve policy, clear blockers, contact
   clients, create CRM tasks, or initiate orders
8. bank-demo proof APIs return Advise-owned scenario, supported-claim, runtime-posture, and
   proof-pack truth for Gateway and Workbench consumption. `POST
   /advisory/bank-demo-proof/proof-packs` fails with HTTP 409 when material proof fields drift from
   the supported-claim register, rejects runtime base URLs that include credentials, query strings,
   or fragments, rejects proof artifact references that include URL/query/fragment/traversal or
   sensitive access-token, credential, AI-input, or implementation-payload path material, redacts
   secrets, tokens, prompts, implementation payloads, trace IDs, and correlation IDs from
   summaries, does not echo rejected sensitive input in HTTP 422 validation responses, and records
   bounded integer `latency_ms` endpoint evidence. Ready `/platform/capabilities` runtime evidence
   must include `advisory.bank_demo_proof` and `advisory_bank_demo_proof` before proof artifacts
   are reused.
   These APIs do not approve
   client-ready publication, external client communication, bank-specific attestations,
   legal/regulatory advice, completed sign-off/approval, or OMS/order/fill/settlement.
9. `GET /platform/capabilities` separates feature enablement from operational readiness and returns
   bounded dependency evidence through `runtime_probe_enabled`, `readiness_basis`, and
   `degraded_reason` without exposing dependency base URLs

## Integration Boundaries

- primary downstream consumer:
  `lotus-gateway`
- governed tactical house-view cohort consumer:
  `lotus-manage`
- key upstreams:
  `lotus-core`, `lotus-risk`
- bounded adjacent integration boundaries:
  `lotus-report`, `lotus-ai`

Contract rule:

`lotus-advise` may orchestrate, persist, and shape advisory workflow evidence, but it must not
become the authority for source portfolio data, risk methodology, performance analytics, report
generation, or downstream execution truth.

## Operations And Runtime Posture

- use `advise.dev.lotus` for canonical local cross-app validation
- use `/health/ready` to confirm local process, persistence, runtime configuration, and proposal
  boot posture before treating the pod as healthy
- use `/platform/capabilities` to confirm upstream dependency and workflow readiness before
  claiming an advisory workflow, demo, or release evidence path is operational
- use `/version` to compare runtime build metadata with retained Main Releasability image release
  evidence
- treat upstream simulation and risk failures as dependency issues first, not as reasons to invent local fallback truth
- keep proposal decision-summary and alternatives behavior aligned to canonical and degraded live evidence
- capture RFC-0028 backend proof with `scripts/capture_rfc0028_backend_proof.py` and review
  `proof-pack.json`, `runtime-posture.json`, `sanitized-runtime-summary.json`, and
  `commercial-material-pack.json` before using demo or RFP material
- keep `live_suite_result_ref`, `live_suite_bundle_ref`, and `output_ref_prefix` as local relative
  proof-artifact references; use `--artifact-ref-prefix` when writing proof artifacts to an
  absolute `--output-dir` so proof-pack asset references remain portable and sanitized
- URL, query, fragment, traversal, and sensitive access-token material is rejected before proof
  capture can proceed
- treat `RFC0028_BACKEND_PROOF_MATERIAL_REVIEW_BLOCKED` and HTTP 409 proof-pack responses as
  material-drift defects that require code, seed, or documentation correction before demo evidence
  is reused
