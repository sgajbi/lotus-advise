# Development Workflow

## Local Working Loop

Use the repository-native commands first:

- `make install`
- `make check`
- `make ci`
- `make ci-local`
- `make ci-local-docker`
- `make run`

## Delivery Model

This repository follows the platform development workflow and CI strategy standard.

Required model:

1. branch from `main`
2. keep one branch per RFC or slice
3. use PR-first delivery
4. keep required checks green
5. finish with `local = remote = main`

## What To Verify During Advisory Changes

Changes to advisory behavior should usually re-check:

1. proposal simulation behavior
2. proposal decision-summary posture
3. proposal alternatives posture
4. lifecycle persistence and versioning behavior
5. upstream-core and upstream-risk dependency alignment
